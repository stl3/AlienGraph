## What Is This?

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) allows us to Tag, Link, and aggregate data together to find trends and commonalities as well as easily search for related content. It uses [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to map relationships between objects commonly known as "Nodes". For example, in the image below we can see the following relationships:

(Person) **EBOscientistA** wrote (Intelligence) **Reddit Post** article in which (Person) **Gary Nolan** commented on and (Person) **Bob Lazar** has similar intelligence on.

To date, we have the following Nodes to which we map relationships between:

- **Person** - a single unique individual
- **Organizations** - Companies, Governments, non-profits, think tanks, etc. 
- **Evidence** - Verifiable evidence that can be substantiated
- **Intelligence** - Any intelligence relating to our topics regardless of validity.
- **Analysis** - Any analysis conducted against an incident, intelligence, or other.

## Why Do We Need This?

1. To build a single comprehensive dataset that anyone can use and understand.
2. To consolidate information (Open Source) using accepted methods and practices adding additional validity to claims.
3. To enable interested parties who don't know where to start by teaching and communicating.
4. To utilize the community as a whole to scale the content making it even more impactful.

----

## Tenets

- All content added will be 100% Open Source and can be freely replicated by any party.
- A community of builders and researchers who accept everyone and anyone.
- Content shall meet a certain threshold of professionalism, authenticity, and validity when necessary.
