# AlienGraph

A public facing Obsidian repository for non-earth originating research and analysis.

https://publish.obsidian.md/aliengraph

## Why

The information, posts, intelligence, claims, events, and persons involved in the overall topic/s regarding non-earth originating species, technology, and other is disorganized with a significant amount of tribal knowledge and technical expertise being lost to the public. Much has happened in the way of government admission, acknowledgement, and open source intelligence. Methods and practices in how to aggregate, analyze, and present this data should be conducted is a more streamlined and professional manner in order to garner more credence and crowd-source content to analyze and validate at scale.


## Contribution and Management

1. All content for the site will be pulled from [our git repository](https://github.com/aGuyOverThere/AlienGraph) and therefore the git repository is the "Source of Truth".
2. Content submissions need to scale which means we want a balance of content scrutiny but limited friction to contribute. Currently, it's just me and I will need additional heads to also review content submissions. Potentially r/Aliens, r/UFOs mods? I'm not sure at this point. 
3. The content will be updated as new information is pushed and will be viewable by anyone at https://publish.obsidian.md/aliengraph
