# AlienGraph

A public facing Obsidian repository for non-earth originating research and analysis.

https://publish.obsidian.md/aliengraph

## Why

The information, posts, intelligence, claims, events, and persons involved in the overall topic/s regarding non-earth originating species, technology, and other is disorganized with a significant amount of tribal knowledge and technical expertise being lost to the public. Much has happened in the way of government admission, acknowledgement, and open source intelligence. Methods and practices in how to aggregate, analyze, and present this data should be conducted is a more streamlined and professional manner in order to garner more credence and crowd-source content to analyze and validate at scale.

## How

This repository contains an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/) that uses linking, tags, and graph theory to build a much larger picture regarding non-earth originating species, technology, and other. You do not have to be an engineer to use this repository or contribute to its content. I've curated a few templates that we can start using as well as iterate and change as needed. 

## Contribution and Management

1. All content for the site will be pulled from this git repository and therefore the git repository is the "Source of Truth".
2. Content submissions need to scale which means we want a balance of content scrutiny but limited friction to contribute. Currently, it's just me and I will need additional heads to also review content submissions. Potentially r/Aliens, r/UFOs mods? I'm not sure at this point. 
3. The content will be updated as new information is pushed and will be viewable by anyone at https://publish.obsidian.md/aliengraph

### [Basic] How to Add Content

1. In any text editor (We obviously recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)) create your content of choice in the appropriate folder (Analysis, Intelligence, Person, Evidence, docs) from a given template, if a template is necessary, located in the `_tempaltes` directory.
2. Save your Markdown file and send it to me in one of the following methods:
	1. Email me the content/links/docs at alienanalyzer@gmail.com
	2. [PENDING APPROVAL FROM DISCORD MODS] Add content to the [r/Aliens Discord](https://discord.gg/KKGAwD4H) with the `#AlienGraph` tag.

3. [OPTIONAL] I use several obsidian plugins to make my life easier. You do not have to use them however, they are wonderful and make generating notes much more simple. Here are the Plugins I am using for temptation:
	1. https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater
	2. https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview
	3. **To Install**:
		1. Settings --> Community Plugins --> Browse --> Search for the plugin name and install. 
4. Add new content (Files, Images, Documents, Analysis, Evidence, Intelligence, etc.) and save it. 
5. Create a Pull request to be reviewed and once approved it will be merged into Main.
